# react-firebase-auth

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

### Pre Requirements

- Create `.env` file and set env variables with firebase config (check `src/firebase/index.js`)
- Create credentials as described https://developers.google.com/identity/sign-in/web/sign-in

I've used [firebaseui](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-firebaseui) for simplify styling.

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.
